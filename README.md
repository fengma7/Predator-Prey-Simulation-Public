# Predator-Prey-Simulation-Public
The intended function of the code is a terminal based simulation that where there are doodlebugs and ants. 

The job of the ants are to evade the doodlebugs and help the queen ant reproduce. There are three types of ants: male ants, female ants, and queen ants. The male and female ants can move around, while the queen ant cannot move unless it has bred. For the queen ant to breed, 25 turns need to pass and then when a male ant comes in contact with the queen ant, the queen ant will spawn 10 new ants. 10 turns after this happens the queen ant will spawn another queen ant and then it can move. If a male or female ant does not move for 5 turns, then the ant will die.  

The job of the doodlebugs are to consume an ant. If the doodlebug does not consume an ant within 1o turns, then the doodlebug will die. If the doodlebug survives 10 turns then it will spawn in another doodlebug.  

The simulation continues to run until three situations:  
* All the ants are dead
* All the doodlebugs are dead
* A cyclic pattern emerges
